                - Docker Images REgistry provided by AWS
                - Push the Docker Images from your machine to ECR and use thse images for Deployment
            - Elastic Kubernetes Services (EKS)
                - This is a Kubernetes Cluster Environment provided by AWS for Managing Microservices based Apps

                - Features
                    - Run the code w/o provisining the serverand the workload aware cluster
                    - Lambda offers the application code execution virtually with any type of backend server application with zero administration(?)
                        - This gives relief from creating VM, Security Grouops, selectcing server env, App deployment, expostings IPs
                        - Upload the ZIP file (containing app package) to the Lambda
                        - Lambda will take responsiblity of allocation compute execution power to run the applciaiton.
                        - This will manage the scaling of traffic automatically 
    - Storing Data
        - RDS
            - MySql, Postgres, MS-SQL, etc.
        - DynamoDB
            - NoQL Database Service on AWS

                    - Machine Learning
                    - AI
            - To access the Storage Services from the client app, the client app must authenticate itself against the service
                - access the Access Key ID and Secret from the IAM role              
    - Security
        - IAM Role
            - Configure the Access of the AWS Resources from the application

                - Security Log                

# Modern Mission Critical Application Dev and Deployment facts
- Development Needs
1. There are frequent updates in app
2. The feature additions is a normal practice 
- Deployments Needs
3. The updates and features must be smoothly integrated in app and deployed seamlessly
4. The App must be deployed for High Availability and Scalability with auto-failure recovery

- for point no 3 and 4, the platform for deployment must be enable for
    - Continuous Develivery and Contineous Integartion (CI/CD)
    - The plotform MUST provide relief from
        - Creating VM with Hardware and Software Configuration
        - The Auto-Failure Recovery must be the default feature
- Kubernetes is an Answer for all the requirements by Google and then they denoted it to the Community
    - Provides following services
        - Cluster Management using 'Node'
            - Node is Virtual Machine
        - Each Node contains Pods
            - Each Pod is a container for the Docker Image to run in it
        - The Auto-Load balancer is provided but it can be configured
        - Auto-Failure Recovery
            - If a Pod in Node is crashed the load is auto shifted to other Pod in same node
            - If Node crash, the other instance is arranged to make sure that the app is high available
        - Netwok Access Topoligies
            - Allows to define Portsnand communication across Nodes and Pods
            - This manages IP subnets to that there are internal and external IPs are configured
                - internal IP, this is used for Communication across Pods and Nodes
                - external IP, this is used for out-side communciation through the loadbalancer  
    - With EKS the Instance managtement service
        - Auto-Extends Nodes if a node is down aka Auto-Calsing Service
        - Generaly these nodes are Amazon VM wtih Linux
        - Cost is dependant on the VM
        - The Network Security Group must be managed by the deployment Team
            - used for providing an access of the Service deployed on POD tom outside world
